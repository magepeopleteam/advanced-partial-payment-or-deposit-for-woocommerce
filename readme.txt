###  Partial Payment Based on payment Term:
A payment plan is a custom partial payment method that you set as you want. For doing that at first you have to create your own payment plan.
At first, you have to choose what kind of payment plan you want to do for a particular product. For example purposes, according to the screenshot we chose a 2 weeks plan and we kept 60 percent of the total price for a deposit, 
the remaining 40 percent of the total price customers were able to pay within 2 weeks. See an overview of this type of deposit method.
